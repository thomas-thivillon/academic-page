abstract: Women carry a disproportionate share of the burden of providing informal care to functionally dependent relatives such as old age adults. In developing economies, this burden tends to fall on the shoulders of female adolescents in particular for cultural and economic reasons. This paper uses original panel data from Senegal to evaluate the effect of caring responsibilities on girlsâ€™ educational attainment. I exploit negative shocks of demand for care work following the death of an old age household member to identify this effect. I show that the death of an elderly household member results in 23% additional education completed over a period of 4 years. I present evidence that changes in demand for informal care within the household are one of the mechanisms at play. These results call for increased attention to specific forms of domestic child labor in public policies in order to reduce gender inequalities in education.

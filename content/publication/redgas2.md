abstract: We evaluate an intervention aimed at reducing household air pollution in Burkina Faso by encouraging households to switch from wood or charcoal to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as their main cooking fuel. We randomize 805 urban households to a subsidy treatment, a credit treatment and a control group. Treated households receive an offer to purchase a gas stove from a local retailer either at a discounted price or at the market price with the option to pay in three installments. We estimate the effects of these capital costs subsidies and consumption loans on the adoption and intensity of use of LPG over a six-month period following treatment. Subsidies and access to credit increase the take-up of gas stoves by 54 and 28 percentage points respectively, suggesting both credit constraints and high price elasticity of demand.

abstract: "_Background:_ Since March 2020, COVID-19 has evolved from a localized outbreak to a global pandemic. We assessed the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in three towns in the Centre Sud region of Burkina Faso.  
<br/>
<br/>
_Methods:_ A population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in three middle-sized cities in Burkina Faso’s Centre Sud region, from June to July 2021. Subjects aged 16 or over at the time of the survey were considered for this seroprevalence study. The Biosynex COVID-19 BSS rapid test was used to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) against SARS-CoV-2. A standardized questionnaire was also administered to collect additional information.  
<br/>
<br/>
_Results:_ A total of 2449 eligible participants (age ≥ 16 years) were identified. Serological tests for COVID-19 were performed in 2155 individuals, of which 2143 valid tests were retained and analyzed. Out of the entire sample, 246 positive tests were observed, corresponding to a prevalence of 11.48%. Prevalence was 9.35% (58 cases) in Kombissiri, 12.86% (80 cases) in Manga and 11.99% (108 cases) in Pô. By gender, 13.37% of women (164 cases) tested positive, and 8.95% of men (82 cases). Women accounted for 66.67% of all positive test subjects. The results from the multivariate analysis show a significantly higher seroprevalence in women (p = 0.007), people over 55 years old (p = 0.004), overweight people (p = 0.026) and those with drinking water sources at home (p = 0.013).
<br/>
<br/>
_Conclusions:_ The results of this study show that the COVID-19 virus also circulates in the population of middle-sized cities in Burkina Faso, far more than officially reported by the information service of the government of Burkina Faso, given the lack of systematic testing in the general population in the country. The study also highlighted the greater vulnerability of women, older and overweight individuals to the epidemic. The preventive measures put in place to fight the pandemic must take these different factors into account."
